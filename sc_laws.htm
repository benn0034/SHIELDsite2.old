						COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE<strong><br />
						<br />
						SECTION 59-65-40.</strong><br />
						Home schooling programs.<br />
						<br />
						(A) Parents or guardians may teach their children at 
						home if the instruction is approved by the district 
						board of trustees of the district in which the children 
						reside. A district board of trustees shall approve home 
						schooling programs which meet the following standards:
						<br />
						<br />
						(1) the parent: <br />
						(a) holds at least a high school diploma or the 
						equivalent general educational development (GED) 
						certificate or <br />
						(b) has earned a baccalaureate degree; <br />
						<br />
						(2) the instructional day is at least four and one-half 
						hours, excluding lunch and recesses, and the 
						instructional year is at least one hundred eighty days;
						<br />
						<br />
						(3) the curriculum includes, but is not limited to, the 
						basic instructional areas of reading, writing, 
						mathematics, science, and social studies and in grades 
						seven through twelve, composition and literature; <br />
						<br />
						(4) as evidence that a student is receiving regular 
						instruction, the parent shall present a system for 
						maintaining and maintain the following records for 
						inspection upon reasonable notice by a representative of 
						the school district: <br />
						(a) a plan book, diary, or other written record 
						indicating subjects taught and activities in which the 
						student and parent engage; <br />
						(b) a portfolio of samples of the student&#39;s academic 
						work; and <br />
						(c) a record of evaluations of the student&#39;s academic 
						progress. A semiannual progress report including 
						attendance records and individualized assessments of the 
						student&#39;s academic progress in each of the basic 
						instructional areas specified in item (3) must be 
						submitted to the school district. <br />
						<br />
						(5) students must have access to library facilities;
						<br />
						<br />
						(6) students must participate in the annual statewide 
						testing program and the Basic Skills Assessment Program 
						approved by the State Board of Education for their 
						appropriate grade level. The tests must be administered 
						by a certified school district employee either with 
						public school students or by special arrangement at the 
						student&#39;s place of instruction, at the parent&#39;s option. 
						The parent is responsible for paying the test 
						administrator if the test is administered at the 
						student&#39;s home; and <br />
						<br />
						(7) parents must agree in writing to hold the district, 
						the district board of trustees and the district&#39;s 
						employees harmless for any educational deficiencies of 
						the student sustained as a result of home instruction.
						<br />
						At any time the school district determines that the 
						parent is not maintaining the home school program in 
						keeping with the standards specified in this section the 
						district board of trustees shall notify the parent to 
						correct the deficiencies within thirty days. If the 
						deficiencies are not corrected within thirty days, the 
						district board of trustees may withdraw its approval.
						<br />
						<br />
						(B) The district board of trustees shall provide for an 
						application process which elicits the information 
						necessary for processing the home schooling request, 
						including a description of the program, the texts and 
						materials to be used, the methods of program evaluation, 
						and the place of instruction. Parents must be notified 
						in advance of the date, place, and time of the meeting 
						at which the application is considered by the board and 
						parents may be heard at the meeting. <br />
						<br />
						(C) Within the first fifteen instructional days of the 
						public school year, students participating in home 
						instruction and eligible for enrollment in the first 
						grade of the public schools must be tested to determine 
						their readiness for the first grade using the readiness 
						instrument approved by the State Board of Education for 
						public school students. If a student is determined to be 
						&quot;not ready&quot; or is determined to lack the necessary 
						emotional maturity, the parent must be advised by 
						appropriate school district personnel whether a 
						kindergarten or a first grade curriculum should be used 
						for the child. Nothing in this section may be 
						interpreted to conflict with a parent&#39;s right to exempt 
						his child from kindergarten as provided in <br />
						<br />
						<strong>Section 59-65-10(A). </strong><br />
						(D) Should a student in a home schooling program score 
						below the test requirements of the promotion standard 
						prescribed for public school students by the State Board 
						of Education for one year, the district board of 
						trustees shall decide whether or not the student shall 
						receive appropriate instructional placement in the 
						public school, special services as a handicapped 
						student, or home schooling with an instructional support 
						system at parental expense. The right of a parent to 
						enroll his child in a private or parochial school as 
						provided in Section 59-65-10(A) is unaffected by this 
						provision. <br />
						<br />
						(E) If a parent is denied permission to begin or 
						continue home schooling by a district board of trustees, 
						the decision of the district board of trustees may be 
						appealed, within ten days, to the State Board of 
						Education. Any appeal from the decision of the State 
						Board of Education must be taken, within thirty days, to 
						the family court. <br />
						<br />
						<strong>SECTION 59-65-45.</strong><br />
						Alternative home schooling requirements.<br />
						<br />
						In lieu of the requirements of Section 59-65-40, parents 
						or guardians may teach their children at home if the 
						instruction is conducted under the auspices of the South 
						Carolina Association of Independent Home Schools. Bona 
						fide membership and continuing compliance with the 
						academic standards of South Carolina Association of 
						Independent Home Schools exempts the home school from 
						the further requirements of Section 59-65-40. <br />
						<br />
						The State Department of Education shall conduct annually 
						a review of the association standards to insure that 
						requirements of the association, at a minimum, include:
						<br />
						<br />
						(a) a parent must hold at least a high school diploma or 
						the equivalent general educational development (GED) 
						certificate; <br />
						(b) the instructional year is at least one hundred 
						eighty days; and <br />
						(c) the curriculum includes, but is not limited to, the 
						basic instructional areas of reading, writing, 
						mathematics, science, and social studies, and in grades 
						seven through twelve, composition and literature. <br />
						<br />
						By January thirtieth of each year, the South Carolina 
						Association of Independent Home Schools shall report the 
						number and grade level of children home schooled through 
						the association to the children&#39;s respective school 
						districts. <br />
						<br />
						<strong>SECTION 59-65-46.<br />
						</strong>Home schooling of foster child.<br />
						<br />
						A foster parent may teach a foster child at home as 
						provided in Sections 59-65-40, 59-65-45, or any other 
						provision of law, if, in addition to any other 
						requirements, home schooling of the child has been 
						approved by the Department of Social Services or other 
						agency having custody of the child. <br />
						<br />
						<strong>SECTION 59-65-47.<br />
						</strong>Associations for home schools; requirements.<br />
						<br />
						In lieu of the requirements of Section 59-65-40 or 
						Section 59-65-45, parents or guardians may teach their 
						children at home if the instruction is conducted under 
						the auspices of an association for home schools which 
						has no fewer than fifty members and meets the 
						requirements of this section. Bona fide membership and 
						continuing compliance with the academic standards of the 
						associations exempts the home school from the further 
						requirements of Section 59-65-40 or Section 59-65-45.
						<br />
						<br />
						The State Department of Education shall conduct annually 
						a review of the association standards to ensure that 
						requirements of the association, at a minimum, include:
						<br />
						<br />
						(a) a parent must hold at least a high school diploma or 
						the equivalent general educational development (GED) 
						certificate; <br />
						(b) the instructional year is at least one hundred 
						eighty days; <br />
						(c) the curriculum includes, but is not limited to, the 
						basic instructional areas of reading, writing, 
						mathematics, science, and social studies, and in grades 
						seven through twelve, composition and literature; and
						<br />
						(d) educational records shall be maintained by the 
						parent-teacher and include: <br />
						<br />
						(1) a plan book, diary, or other record indicating 
						subjects taught and activities in which the student and 
						parent-teacher engage; <br />
						(2) a portfolio of samples of the student&#39;s academic 
						work; and <br />
						(3) a semiannual progress report including attendance 
						records and individualized documentation of the 
						student&#39;s academic progress in each of the basic 
						instructional areas specified in item (c) above. <br />
						<br />
						By January thirtieth of each year, all associations 
						shall report the number and grade level of children home 
						schooled through the association to the children&#39;s 
						respective school districts. <br />
						[Kindergarten waiver] <br />
						<br />
						<strong>SECTION 59-65-10.<br />
						</strong>Responsibility of parent or guardian; 
						notification by school district of availability of 
						kindergarten; transportation for kindergarten pupils.<br />
						<br />
						(A) All parents or guardians shall cause their children 
						or wards to attend regularly a public or private school 
						or kindergarten of this State which has been approved by 
						the State Board of Education or a member school of the 
						South Carolina Independent Schools&#39; Association or some 
						similar organization, or a parochial, denominational, or 
						church-related school, or other programs which have been 
						approved by the State Board of Education from the school 
						year in which the child or ward is five years of age 
						before September first until the child or ward attains 
						his seventeenth birthday or graduates from high school. 
						A parent or guardian whose child or ward is not six 
						years of age on or before the first day of September of 
						a particular school year may elect for their child or 
						ward not to attend kindergarten. For this purpose, the 
						parent or guardian shall sign a written document making 
						the election with the governing body of the school 
						district in which the parent or guardian resides. The 
						form of this written document must be prescribed by 
						regulation of the Department of Education. Upon the 
						written election being executed, that child or ward may 
						not be required to attend kindergarten. <br />
						<br />
						(B) Each school district shall provide transportation to 
						and from public school for all pupils enrolled in public 
						kindergarten classes who request the transportation. 
						Regulations of the State Board of Education governing 
						the operation of school buses shall apply. <br />
						<br />
						<strong>SECTION 59-65-20.<br />
						</strong>Penalty for failure to enroll or cause child to 
						attend school.<br />
						<br />
						Any parent or guardian who neglects to enroll his child 
						or ward or refuses to make such child or ward attend 
						school shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than 
						fifty dollars or be imprisoned not more than thirty 
						days; each day&#39;s absence shall constitute a separate 
						offense; provided, the court may in its discretion 
						suspend the sentence of anyone convicted of the 
						provisions of this article. <br />
